This is a final project to create a stock website that allows users to participate in a stock exchange.

Admin users will be able to add stocks to the market and keep track of the stocks that exist.

The stock exchange will have limited hours along with other functionality.

This project will be created with React, Github, and AWS technologies for hosting. 

AWS will also be used to create a database for user data and stock information. 

Users will be protected with verification.
